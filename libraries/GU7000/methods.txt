                           GLOSSARY
****************************************************************

ASCII Variant: National variations of ASCII that change the
        graphical representation of certain ASCII characters
        to be used for national characters such as currency
        signs.

Custom Characters: Custom characters can be defined to change
        the graphical representation of ASCII characters between
        0x20 and 0xFF. There are two types of custom characters:
        those stored in RAM and those stored in FROM.
        
        Characters stored in RAM will be erased after a reset
        or initialization. Each of the 16 RAM characters can
        be individually assigned to an ASCII character code,
        deleted, and changed.
        
        Characters stored in FROM are not erased after a
        reset or initialization. This can be used to permanently
        store character sets. All 224 characters must be stored
        and used at once. FROM is only available on -79**
        models.
        
        Custom characters are also called User-Defined Fonts.

FROM:  Flash ROM on the VFD module that is used to store
        character data. Unlike custom character RAM, this memory
        is not cleared after a reset or initialization.

Home Position: the top left position on the display (0,0).

Hidden Screen Area: Modules may have more display memory than
        the amount required to display the visible screen area.
        With scrolling, this memory can be used to do scrolling
        animation or flip between two different screens if the
        module has enough memory. Dots drawn to the hidden
        screen area are not shown until that dot is scrolled
        into the visible screen area. See also Visible Screen
        Area.

Visible Screen Area: The visible screen area is the area of the
        screen that is currently being displayed on the module.
        The ends of this area can be changed by scrolling the
        screen. By default, this area starts from the top-left
        position on the display (0,0). See also Hidden Screen
        Area.

****************************************************************

----------------------------------------------------------------
void GU7000_back();
Move the cursor left one fixed-width character. The cursor goes
to the end of the previous line if the cursor is within one
fixed-width character of the beginning of a line. This command is
ignored if the cursor is within one fixed-width character of
home position, the command is ignored.

----------------------------------------------------------------
void GU7000_blinkScreen();
This command stops the screen from blinking because of a
previous call to GU7000_blinkScreen(). This command may be used
after GU7000_blinkScreen(bool,uint8_t,uint8_t,uint8_t).

----------------------------------------------------------------
GU7000_blinkScreen(bool enable, bool reverse, uint8_t onTime, uint8_t offTime, uint8_t times);
Causes the screen to blink.

enable:  true enables screen blinking
    false disables screen blinking including ones already
    in progress.
reverse: true inverts the screen instead of blanking for offTime
onTime:  the time the display is on per cycle in 1.35ms units
offTime: the time the display is off per cycle in 1.35ms units
times:   the number of times to blink the screen.
    0 Causes the screen to blink until this method is called
    again or an initialization or reset is issued.

----------------------------------------------------------------
void GU7000_carriageReturn();
Moves the cursor to left-most dot of the current line.

----------------------------------------------------------------
void GU7000_clearScreen();
Turns off all of the dots on the screen and moves the cursor
to the home position.

----------------------------------------------------------------
void GU7000_cursorOff();
Turn the cursor off.

----------------------------------------------------------------
void GU7000_cursorOn();
Turn the cursor on.

----------------------------------------------------------------
void GU7000_defineCustomChar(uint8_t code, uint8_t format, const uint8_t *data);
Define a custom character. If a custom character has already
been defined with the same character number, the previous one
is overwritten. Only sixteen custom characters may be defined
at once. To display custom characters, they must be enabled with
GU7000_enableCustomChars(). Redefining a custom character will
not change the appearance of the characters already printed on
the screen. Custom characters will be erased after
initialization, a reset, or when power is lost.

Example
        uint8_t data[] = {
                0b11111,
                0b10001,
                0b10001,
                0b10001,
                0b10001,
                0b10001,
                0b11111 };
        // Replace the space character (0x20) with a 5×8 box.
        vfd.GU7000_useCustomChars(true);
        vfd.GU7000_defineCustomChar(0x20, LCDFormat, data);
        vfd.print((char)0x20);

code:   character code to redefine (0x20-0xFF)
format: the bitmap format data uses
        one of: CUUFormat, GU70005x7Format, or GU70007x8Format.

data:   data in the format defined above.

----------------------------------------------------------------
void GU7000_defineWindow(uint8_t window, unsigned x, unsigned y, unsigned width, unsigned height);
Define a window on the screen. When a window is selected with
GU7000_selectWindow(), text is wrapped to fit in the window and
graphics are clipped so that no write may occur outside of the
window. If the window was previously defined, the window will be
resized. This function does not select the defined window.

window: 1-4 for user-defined windows 1 to 4.
x:      the x coordinate of the upper-left corner of window
y:      the y coordinate of the upper-left corner of window
width:  width of the window
height: height of the window

----------------------------------------------------------------
void GU7000_deleteCustomChar(uint8_t code);
Delete a custom character. If the code has not been used to
define a custom character, then the command is ignored.

code:   the ASCII character code of the custom character to
    delete (0x20-0xFF)

----------------------------------------------------------------
void GU7000_deleteWindow(uint8_t window);
Delete a previously defined window on the screen. If the window
was not defined, the command is ignored. Window 0 cannot be
deleted.

window: 1-4 for user-defined windows 1 to 4.

----------------------------------------------------------------
void GU7000_displayOff();
Turn off the display. Turning off the display sends the module
into a low power mode consuming less power than turning all dots
off. Commands will still be executed by the module but the
results will not be visible until GU7000_displayOn() is executed.

----------------------------------------------------------------
void GU7000_displayOn();
Turn on the display after turning it off with GU7000_displayOff().

----------------------------------------------------------------
void GU7000_drawFROMImage(unsigned long address, uint8_t srcHeight, unsigned width, uint8_t height);
Draw an image from FROM to the screen at the current cursor
position. The cursor is not moved after this command. You may
draw part of a bitmap by specifying a width and height less than
the width of the actual bitmap in FROM. srcHeight must always
be set to the height of the actual bitmap in FROM. See
GU7000_showImage() for image format details. Heights must be
divisible by 8; they are rounded down otherwise. This command
is only available on the -79** models.

address:   address in FROM 0-0x7FFFF
srcHeight: total height of image
width:     width of bitmap to display
height:    height of bitmap to display (may be less than srcHeight)

----------------------------------------------------------------
void GU7000_drawImage(unsigned width, uint8_t height, const uint8_t *data);
Draw an image in data to the screen at the current cursor
position. The cursor is not moved after this command. You may
draw part of a bitmap by specifying a width less than the actual
image width in data. The height must always match. Height must
be divisible by 8; it is rounded down otherwise.

width:  width of bitmap to display
height: height of bitmap to display
data:   image data in the format:
    Dots are packed into a byte in an 8-dot column.
    The lowest bit (bit 0) is the top dot.
    The 8-dot bytes form a column that is the total height of
      the bitmap.
    
    Example:
      A 3×16 image would be defined with the 6 bytes: A-F.
      A0, B0, etc. indicates bit 0 of byte A.
      
        A0 C0 E0
        A1 C1 E1
        A2 C2 E2
        A3 C3 E3
        A4 C4 E4
        A5 C5 E5
        A6 C6 E6
        A7 C7 E7
        B0 D0 F0
        B1 D1 F1
        B2 D2 F2
        B3 D3 F3
        B4 D4 F4
        B5 D5 F5
        B6 D6 F6
        B7 D7 F7

----------------------------------------------------------------
void GU7000_fillRect(unsigned x0, unsigned y0, unsigned x1, unsigned y1, bool on=true);
Fill a rectangle. Areas of the rectangle that are outside of the
window will be clipped. The currently selected composition mode
will be used to set the dots. Since a buffer 8*(y1-y0) bytes
in length is allocated from the stack, calling this method from
deeply nested functions may cause a stack overflow and corrupt
data.

x0:  the x coordinate of the upper-left corner of window
y0:  the y coordinate of the upper-left corner of window
x1:  the x coordinate of the bottom-right corner of window
y1:  the y coordinate of the bottom-right corner of window

----------------------------------------------------------------
void GU7000_forward();
Move the cursor right one fixed-width character. The cursor goes
to the beginning of the next line if was within one fixed-width
character of the end of the line. If the row was the last, in
wrapping mode, the cursor will return to the home position. In
vertical mode, the display shifts up one line as described in
GU7000_lineFeed(). In horizontal scroll mode, moving forward after
the end of any line causes that line to scroll horizontally.

----------------------------------------------------------------
void GU7000_home();
Move the cursor to the top left corner of the screen: (0,0).

----------------------------------------------------------------
void GU7000_init();
Send the initialization command returning the module to its
initial state:
    Cursor                      Disabled, Home Position
    Multi-Byte Character Set    Disabled, Korean
    Custom Characters           Disabled, None Defined
    ASCII Variant               0
    Character Set               0
    Scroll Mode                 Wrapping Mode
    Horizontal Scroll Speed     0
    Invert                      Disabled
    Composition Mode            Normal
    Screen Brightness           100%
    Display                     Enabled
    Screen Saver                None
    Font Style                  Fixed, Uneven Spacing
    Font Size                   1×1
    Window                      0
    Screens Relationship        Separate

----------------------------------------------------------------
void GU7000_invertOff();
Draw dots normally (not inverted). Only dots drawn after this
command will be affected. Previously draw dots will not change.
See also GU7000_invertOn().

----------------------------------------------------------------
void GU7000_invertOn();
Draw dots to the screen in the opposite state that they were
specified in. Lit dots are drawn unlit and dots that were
specified unlit are drawn lit. Turning off invert mode does not
alter dots already on the screen. For example, when drawing the
character "o" to the screen with inversion on, the ring of the
character will not be lit and the inside and outside will be
lit. Only dots drawn after this command will be affected.
Previously draw dots will not change.

----------------------------------------------------------------
void GU7000_joinScreens();
Join the visible and hidden screen areas. When joined, text will
wrap only at the right edge of the hidden screen area regardless
of which screen the cursor started in. This mode is not enabled
by default. To separate the screens, use GU7000_separateScreens().

----------------------------------------------------------------
void GU7000_lineFeed();
Move the cursor down one line. The column remains the same.
When the cursor is on the bottom line in wrapping mode, the
cursor moves to the home position. In vertical scroll mode, a
linefeed causes the display to shift up one line without moving
the cursor. The contents of the top line are lost and the bottom
line is filled with space characters (0x20). In horizontal
scrolling mode, linefeed is ignored.

----------------------------------------------------------------
void GU7000_reset();
Perform a hardware reset on the display. Not every interface
supports this method. Please consult the target module's
spec to determine if the module has a reset pin.

You can find the spec for Noritake GU-7000 VFD module at
http://www.noritake-elec.com/7000.htm

----------------------------------------------------------------
void GU7000_screenSaver(uint8_t mode);
Set the screen saver.

mode:
    0x02 or AllDotsOffSaver
        Turn all dots on the display off
    0x03 or AllDotsOnSaver
        Turn all dots on the display on

----------------------------------------------------------------
void GU7000_scrollScreen(unsigned x, unsigned y, unsigned count, uint8_t speed);
Scroll the screen left. The screen will move by (x,y) each step.
Count specifies the number of steps. Speed determines the delay
between steps. At the end of the operation, the display will
have moved by (x*count, y*count) and taken count*speed*14ms.

x:     the number of dots to scroll horizontally each step
y:     the number of dots to scroll vertically each step
count: the number of times to move
speed: delay time between steps in 14ms units (0-255 * 14ms)

----------------------------------------------------------------
void GU7000_selectWindow(uint8_t window);
Select the current window. The window controls where graphic and
text operations are allowed to write. Text is wrapped to fit the
window. Window 0 is special and specifies the entire screen.
GU7000_enableIndependentScreenMode() specifies the boundaries of
the window. Windows 1 to 4 are user-defined windows and must be
defined with GU7000_defineWindow().

window: 0-4 for windows 0 to 4.

----------------------------------------------------------------
void GU7000_separateScreens();
Separating the visible and hidden screen areas causes text to
wrap around at the edge of the visible screen (or the hidden
screen area if the cursor was in the hidden screen before the
print operation). This mode is the default. To join the screens,
use GU7000_joinScreens().

----------------------------------------------------------------
void GU7000_setAsciiVariant(uint8_t code);
Select which national variant of ASCII will be used.
This setting affects the appearance of characters: 0x23, 0x24,
0x40, 0x5B, 0x5C, 0x5D, 0x5E, 0x60, 0x7B, 0x7C, 0x7D, 0x7E.
See the target module's specification for the appearance of
those characters in the given variant.

code:
    0x00    America (default)
    0x01    France
    0x02    Germany
    0x03    England
    0x04    Denmark 1

void GU7000_setCharset(uint8_t code);
Set the character set of characters printed to the screen. Only
characters printed after this command will be affected.
Previously printed characters will not be changed. This command
changes characters 0x80-0xFF. See also GU7000_setAsciiVariant().
See the target module's specification for the appearance of
those characters in the given character set. Custom characters
defined in the range of 0x80-0xFF will still be shown regardless
of which character set is in use as long as custom characters
are enabled with GU7000_useCustomChars().
This command only affects the single-byte character set. Set the
multi-byte character set with GU7000_setMultibyteCharset().

code:
    0x00    PC437 (USA - Euro std) (default)

        Only dots that are set in corresponding positions in
        the source and display are enabled.
    0x03 XorCompositionMode
        Only dots that are set in the source or display but
        not both are enabled. Dots that are set in neither
        are turned off on the display.    

----------------------------------------------------------------
void GU7000_setCursor(unsigned x, unsigned y);
Move the cursor to the given dot. The command is ignored if
either of the x or y coordinates are beyond the hidden screen
area. Dots are numbered from (0,0), the top left of the
screen to the bottom right. Y coordinate is rounded down to the
next dot divisible by 8. This command allows you to move the
cursor into the hidden screen area. See the definitions of
Visible Screen Area and Hidden Screen Area

x: x coordinate
y: y coordinate

----------------------------------------------------------------
void GU7000_setFontSize(uint8_t x, uint8_t y, bool tall);
Set the size of characters printed to the screen. Only
characters printed after this command will be affected.
Previously printed characters will not change. This does not
affect the font style.

x:    1-4 for 1×, 2×, 3×, and 4× normal width
y:    1-2 for 1×, and 2×
tall: true selects the 8×16 font; false selects the 5×7 font.
    The 8×16 font must be selected to use multi-byte characters.
    (This is only available on -79** models)

----------------------------------------------------------------
void GU7000_setFontStyle(bool proportional, bool evenSpacing);
Set the style of characters printed to the screen. Only
characters printed after this command will be affected.
Previously printed characters will not change. This does not
affect the font size.

proportional: true=variable width font
              false=fixed width font
evenSpacing:  true=use an extra dot on the left
              false=no extra dot is used on the left

----------------------------------------------------------------
void GU7000_setHorizScrollSpeed(uint8_t speed);
Set the speed at which the display scrolls in horizontal
scrolling mode. The exact time unit used by this command depends
on the module. See the target module's spec.

You can find the spec for Noritake GU-7000 VFD module at
http://www.noritake-elec.com/7000.htm

time:   0       scroll by character
        1       T ms / 2 dot
        2-31    (speed-1)*T ms/dot

----------------------------------------------------------------
void GU7000_setMultibyteCharset(uint8_t code);
Set which multi-byte character set is used. Multi-byte character
sets must first be enabled with GU7000_enableMultibyteCharMode().
Multi-byte characters can only be printed when the tall (8×16)
font is selected with GU7000_setFontSize(). This is only available
on -79** models.

code:
    0x00    Japanese            JIS X 0208 (Shift-JIS)
    0x01    Korean              KSC5601-87
    0x02    Simplified Chinese  GB2312-80
    0x03    Traditional Chinese Big-5

----------------------------------------------------------------
void GU7000_setScreenBrightness(int level);
Set the display brightness. The maximum value is determined by
the target module. Giving the level 0% will cause the display
to turn off by calling GU7000_displayOff().

level:  brightness level in percent (0-100%).
    The default brightness level is 100%

----------------------------------------------------------------
void GU7000_setScrollMode(uint8_t mode);
Set the scroll mode of the display.

mode:
    0x01 or WrappingMode
        Normal mode. The cursor wraps around at the
        edges of lines and from the end of the display
        to the top.
    0x02 or VertScrollMode
        Advancing past the last line shifts the text
        on the screen up and fills the last line of the
        screen with space characters (0x20). This otherwise
        acts as wrapping mode.
    0x03 or HorizScrollMode
        Advancing past the end of a line shifts
        text leftwards on the cursor line and prints a space at
        the end of the line. Scrolling speed is affected by
        GU7000_setHorizScrollSpeed().

----------------------------------------------------------------
void GU7000_useCustomChars(bool enable);
Enable or disable custom characters. You must enable custom
characters before attempting to create, delete, or use them.
Disabling custom characters does not delete characters already
created nor does it redraw custom characters already printed to
the screen. See GU7000_defineCustomChar() for an example of how
to use and define custom characters.

enable: true enables custom characters
        false disables custom characters

----------------------------------------------------------------
void GU7000_useMultibyteChars(bool enable);
Enable multi-byte character sets. Once multi-byte mode has been
enabled, you must select the character set to use with
GU7000_setMultibyteCharset(). Multi-byte characters may only be
printed when the tall (8×16) font is selected with
GU7000_setFontSize(). The multi-byte character set will not be
reset by disabling multi-byte mode. This is only available on
-79** models.

enable: true enables multi-byte character sets
        false disables multi-byte character sets

----------------------------------------------------------------
